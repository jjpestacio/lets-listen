# Let's Listen

Let's Listen is a web application that enables music to be queued to and played from a centralized platform. The queue enables friends to listen to everyone's music, relieving the designated DJ from always playing music. Music is streamed and queued from YouTube.

## Usage

## Features

* Separate rooms
* Streaming from the device of a designated DJ
* Queue music from YouTube
* Designed to work on laptops, desktops, and mobile devices

## Notes

I decided to redo my original implementation of [Let's Listen](https://github.com/jjpestacio/lets-listen-v1) to practice better designing skills. I spent much more time thinking about the design and structure of the overall program before jumping into the actual programming. By doing this, I was able to make the application more easily scalable.

I believe one of my major faults during my first implementation was disregarding the layout and overall stylistic design of the page. I initially thought it would be better practice to style everything after the main functionality had been layed out, however I did not realize the affect on the modularity of the components it had. During my second implementation, I decided to keep design and layout in mind, and it helped me modularize components much more effectively.

Although I was a bit skeptical about redoing a project that I had already done before, I am very happy that I decided to do so. I was able to improve on the mistakes I made from the first process by applying better development strategies.
